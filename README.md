Bootstrap plan:
- need to create an image which is able to build packages and eventually, opkg
- install to the host drive:
	- emutos
	- freemint
- install to the cross image:
	- bash
	- awk
	- binutils
	- coreutils
	- gcc
	- grep
	- openssh
	- perl 5.6 (for native openssh)
	- sed
	- (maybe others, depending on 'make check' requirements of building packages)
- use a cross-compiler to build and install to both the cross and native image:
	- mintlib (also create an .ipk)
	- fdlibm (also create an .ipk)
- ssh to the cross image, build and install to the native image (also create an .ipk for each of them):
	- make
	- awk
	- coreutils
	- grep
	- sed
	- perl (perhaps build the one from sparemint?)
	- bash
- (later...):
	- zlib
	- bzip2
	- xz
	- zstd
	- openssl
	- openssh
	- libarchive
	- opkg
	- (auto tools but this shouldn't be needed when ./configure is available)
	- (binutils)
	- (gcc)
